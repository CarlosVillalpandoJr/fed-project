## PACT UI Challenge

**Task**: Provided is a JSON file of product data representing one product (a dress) 
from PACT's API that is used to display on the website. 
Using this data, generate a product carousel that displays the dress in a way that you would expect to see it on any apparel website. Give yourself no more than four hours. Make it fun, but show off your technical chops!
